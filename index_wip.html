     Domino is a system to program the data plane of high-speed programmable
     routers and help design them in the first place. Domino provides two
     constructs: a high-level abstraction called a packet transaction that allows
     programmers to conveniently express data-plane algorithms, and a low-level
     abstraction called an atom that allows router designers to specify their
     instruction sets. A compiler automatically configures atoms from packet
     transactions, and can also be used interactively to design atoms.

<dt><p>What motivated this work?</p></dt>
<dd><p>
Today, the internals of a data network (i.e., the routers and switches that
forward packets) are largely treated as fixed devices whose functionality
cannot be modified. This is because they are built out of dedicated hardware
specialized to forwarding. As a result, there is no pathway to trying out any
algorithm that requires changes to the switch hardware. Examples of these
include algorithms for network measurement, congestion control with network
support, network security algorithms and load balancing---essentially any
algorithm that modifies or inspects the packet (header or data) as it transits
the switch. The goal here was to see how to make router hardware programmable
enough to support such algorithms, while continuing to provide high
performance.
</p></dd>

<dt><p>How does this relate to software-defined networking?</p></dt>
<dd><p>
Software-defined networking (SDN)---at least as embodied by OpenFlow---allows an
operator to flexibly specify the router's control plane: e.g., which packets
should take which paths within the network (routing), and whether packets on
certain ports should be dropped (access control). It does so by exposing a
unified interface to the routing tables across many switches (OpenFlow) and
allowing a central entity (the control program) to populate these routing
tables as desired.
</p>

<p>
To ensure it caters to the common denominator of switches, OpenFlow doesn't
allow you to change the fundamental packet processing functionality of the
switch: it is still restricted to standard forwarding based on exact, ternary,
or longest-prefix matches. This work can be viewed as extending the benefits of
software-defined networking to the data plane as well.
</p></dd>

<dt><p>How does this relate to recent work on programmable switches?</p></dt>
<dd>
<p>
This work is certainly inspired by work on programmable switch architectures.
However, these switches still support fairly limited state manipulation at high
speed (e.g., just incrementing a counter). One of our goals was to formalize
these emerging switch architectures through a machine model we call Banzai
(packet-transactions/banzai) that allows us to instantiate and simulate many
different switches with different capacbilities for manipulating state on the
switch.
</p>
</dd>

<dt><p>How does this relate to P4?</p></dt>
<dd>
<p>
The P4 programming language is ideally suited to programming packet-processing
tasks that don't manipulate state on the switch, e.g., packet forwarding and
access control. However, it's a very low-level interface for programming
data-plane algorithms that manipulate state because it requires us to manually
configure a programmable switch pipeline to implement the algorithm. For many
algorithms, e.g., <a
href="http://queue.acm.org/appendices/codel.html">CoDel</a>, the algorithm is
best expressed as a snippet of code in an imperative language.
</p>
<p>
Our compiler backend can autogenerate P4 from packet transactions written in
the Domino language. Looking to the future, we hope this work suggests
high-level abstractions that could migrate into P4.
