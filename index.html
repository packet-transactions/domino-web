     Domino is a system to program the data plane of high-speed programmable
     routers and help design such programmable routers in the first place. Domino
     provides two constructs: a high-level abstraction called a packet transaction
     that allows programmers to conveniently express data-plane algorithms, and a
     low-level abstraction called an atom that allows router designers to specify
     their instruction sets. A compiler automatically configures atoms from packet
     transactions, and can also be used interactively to design atoms.

<dt><p>What motivated this work?</p></dt>
<dd><p>
Today, the internals of a data network (i.e., the routers and switches that
forward packets) are largely treated as fixed devices whose functionality
cannot be modified. This is because they are built out of dedicated hardware
specialized to forwarding. Further, this hardware cannot be modified once built.
</p>

<p>
 As a result, there is no pathway to trying out any algorithm that requires
changing switch hardware. Examples of these include algorithms for network
measurement, congestion control with network support, network security
algorithms and load balancing---essentially anything that modifies or inspects
the packet (header or data) as it transits the switch. Our goal was to see how
to make router hardware flexible enough to support such algorithms, while
still providing high performance.
</p></dd>

<dt><p>How does Domino work?</p></dt>
<dd><p> The Domino system has three main ideas. First is an abstraction for
programming algorithms called packet transactions and an imperative language,
called Domino, to program them. Second is a model for how switch hardware
called Banzai, which allows us to experiment with different switches in
simulation.  Third, a compiler from Domino programs to Banzai switches. We
describe each below.  </p>

<p>
A programmer first writes code for a packet-processing algorithm using a packet
transaction. A packet transaction is a block of code written in an imperative
language called Domino. Intuitively, packet transactions capture the packet
processing logic for any packet. An <a href="https://github.com/packet-transactions/domino-examples/blob/master/domino_programs/sampling.c">example</a> of a packet transaction is an
algorithm that counts from 0 to N-1 and samples every Nth packet. Other examples
used in our paper are available
<a href="https://github.com/packet-transactions/domino-examples/blob/master/domino_programs">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
 Packet transactions provide simple semantics: the programmer sees transactions
executing serially across packets with no overlap of transaction execution
between packets. The underlying switch hardware, however, is heavily pipelined,
with several tens of pipeline stages operating on every packet.
</p>

<p>
To represent this hardware and experiment with different switch hardware,
we created a machine model called Banzai. Banzai is a C++ <a
href="https://github.com/packet-transactions/banzai">simulator</a> of
programmable switch hardware.
</p>

<p> To represent the hardware's instruction set, we introduced the notion of an
atom, which represents atomic operations that are supported natively by the
switch hardware. Atoms are atomic in the sense that any updates to switch state
as part of the atom's operation are visible to the next packet arriving at that
atom. <a href="https://github.com/packet-transactions/domino-examples/blob/master/banzai_atoms/raw.sk">
One example atom</a> allows the programmer to increment a switch counter by a
programmable packet field, the updated value of the counter is available to the
very next packet. Several example atoms are available <a href="https://github.com/packet-transactions/domino-examples/blob/master/banzai_atoms">here</a>. </p>

<p>Banzai lets us experiment with different programmable switches by creating
an array of such atoms: the horizontal axis represents the number of stages in
the pipeline and the vertical axis represents the number of atoms that can operate
in parallel on a packet in each stage. </p>

<p> The final piece is the <a href="https://github.com/packet-transactions/domino">compiler</a>, which goes from packet transactions to
atom configurations. Unlike a traditional compiler, however, the Domino
compiler can reject programs because they cannot be supported by the switch's
atoms. As an example, an algorithm that needs to atomically increment a counter
will not run on hardware that doesn't provide an atom for this counter. This is
unavoidable: a switch pipeline is designed to run at a specific rate (also known
as the line rate) regardless
of the workload thrown at it, so some programs will inevitably be too complex
for the pipeline.  </p>

<p class="text-center"><img width="600" src="overview.png"></p>

</dd>

<dt><p>What algorithms can/can't you express in Domino?</p></dt>
<dd>
<p> Formally, any algorithm that doesn't have an unbounded for loop. The Domino
language doesn't have for loops because there is no sensible ways to process a
packet forever in a switch that guarantees line rate under all circumstances.
Domino also forbids acess to packet payloads, which is required for algorithms
like deep-packet inspection, because it is challenging to parse these payloads
at the high speeds supported by switches today.

</dd>

<dt><p>How does the compiler work?</p></dt>
<dd>
<p> The compiler has two main steps. First, it goes from the sequential packet
transaction provided by the programmer to a pipeline of
codelets: small code fragments that, if run atomically, guarantee the packet
transaction's semantics. This process requires us to track dependencies between
different operations within the same packet transaction, and more importantly,
different operations across different packet transactions (through state
variables). Section 4.2 of the paper explains this in further detail. </p>

<p> Once we have the codelet pipeline, we map each codelet in the pipeline to
an atom available in the hardware. To do this, we ask the question: can we
configure the atom so that it implements a given codelet? By configuring the
atom, we mean setting certain configuration bits such as the choice of which
packet field to add to an atomic counter, or an immediate operand used by the
atom. This is exactly the problem tackled by <a
href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/asolar/papers/asplos06-final.pdf">program
sketching</a>, where "holes" in an incomplete program (in our case,
configuration bits in an atom) need to be filled up to match a spec (codelets).
</p>

<p>
For this atom mapping problem, we use the <a
href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/asolar/manual.pdf">SKETCH tool</a>,
which implements the algorithm from the program sketching paper above. As a
result, we directly use SKETCH as the language to <a
href="https://github.com/packet-transactions/domino-examples/blob/master/banzai_atoms">
represent our atoms</a>.
</p>
</dd>

<dt><p>How did you design the atoms?</p></dt>
<dd>
<p>
We went through some of our example programs, and identified stateful
operations in them. We then created an atom covering these operations.  For
example, a bloom filter requires the ability to either read or write a bit in
an array, but not the ability to read, add, and write back.
</p>

<p>
With the atom we just created to read/write a bit, we tried to compile more example programs.
Inevitably, some program wouldn't compile. For instance, a heavy-hitter
detection algorithm employs a count-min sketch, which internally requires the
ability to increment an array entry, which the simpler read/write atom above
can't support. We keep iterating till we can generate a single atom that covers all
the algorithms we care about.
</p>
</dd>

<dt><p>Do these atoms generalize to unanticipated use cases?</p></dt>

<dd>
<p>
We don't know for sure. We looked at a subset of our <a
href="https://github.com/packet-transactions/domino-examples/blob/master/domino_programs">examples</a>
to design our 7 atoms. We found that some atoms that we designed for one
algorithm also turned out to be useful for a new one: for instance, we designed
the <a href="https://github.com/packet-transactions/domino-examples/blob/master/banzai_atoms/pred_raw.sk">predicated read-add-write atom</a> (conditionally update a running sum)
with <a href="https://github.com/packet-transactions/domino-examples/blob/master/domino_programs/flowlets.c">flowlet switching</a> in mind,
but it turned out to be useful for the <a href="https://github.com/packet-transactions/domino-examples/blob/master/domino_programs/rcp.c">Rate-Control Protocol</a> as well.
</p>

<p>
Whether this is more generally true is an interesting question that we don't have
an answer to. While we took
some care to ensure we were developing future-proof atoms, answering this question
would require us to create a corpus of algorithms, design atoms based on one
subset of the corpus, and then check their utility for a disjoint subset.
</p>
</dd>

<dt><p>Are these atoms practical?</p></dt>
<dd>
<p>
Yes. We wrote these atoms as
<a href="https://github.com/packet-transactions/atomsyn">Verilog circuits</a> and
synthesized them to a recent 32-nm transistor library. All atoms meet timing at
1 GHz (the clock rate of a typical switch pipeline) and cost very little area
in silicon. These numbers are available in Table 4 of the <a href="http://web.mit.edu/domino/domino-sigcomm.pdf">paper</a> and are also reproduced below.

<p class="text-center"><img width="800" src="table.png"></p>

</p>
</dd>

<dt><p>What if the compiler rejects the program?</p></dt>
<dd>
<p>
For now, the programmer modifies the program and tries it again. You could
imagine running an "approximated version" of the program, or providing compiler
hints that tell the programmer how to fix it. The right interface to a
programmer when the program is rejected is still unclear. However, one
thing is inherent to a programmable switch: there will be programs that cannot
be run with transactional semantics at line rate, so we either need to reject
them or relax their semantics. This is unlike a software router, where all
programs run, but program performance is variable and depends on program
complexity.
</p>
</dd>
</dd>

<dt><p>Does the compiler accept all programs that can run on the switch?</p></dt>
<dd>
<p>
No, the compiler does the best it can and doesn't currently optimize very much.
For instance, it may be possible (and desirable) to "fuse" two codelets into
the same atom, when a switch is strapped for atoms. However, by not carrying
out this and other potential optimizations, the compiler may conservatively
reject a correct program.
</p>
</dd>

<dt><p>How does this relate to software-defined networking?</p></dt>
<dd><p>
Software-defined networking---at least as embodied by <a href="http://www.sigcomm.org/sites/default/files/ccr/papers/2008/April/1355734-1355746.pdf">OpenFlow</a>---allows an
operator to flexibly specify the router's control plane: e.g., which packets
should take which paths within the network (routing), and whether packets on
certain ports should be dropped (access control). It does so by exposing a
unified interface to the routing tables across many switches (OpenFlow) and
allowing a central entity (the control program) to populate these routing
tables as desired.
</p>

<p>
To ensure it caters to the common denominator of switches, OpenFlow doesn't
allow you to change the fundamental packet processing functionality of the
switch: it is still restricted to standard forwarding based on exact, ternary,
or longest-prefix matches. This work can be viewed as extending the benefits of
software-defined networking to programming the data plane as well.
</p></dd>

<dt><p>How does this relate to recent work on programmable switches?</p></dt>
<dd>
<p>
This work is certainly inspired by work on <a href="http://yuba.stanford.edu/~grg/docs/sdn-chip-sigcomm-2013.pdf">programmable switch architectures</a>.
However, <a href="http://www.cavium.com/XPliant-Ethernet-Switch-Product-Family.html">these</a>
<a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ethernet-products/switch-silicon/ethernet-switch-fm6000-sdn-paper.html">switches</a> still support fairly limited state manipulation at high
speed (e.g., incrementing a counter). One of our goals was to formalize
these emerging switch architectures through a simple machine model (Banzai)
that captures their essence.
</p>
</dd>

<dt><p>How does this relate to P4?</p></dt>
<dd>
<p>
The <a href="http://p4.org">P4</a> programming language is ideally suited to programming packet-processing
tasks that don't manipulate state on the switch, e.g., packet forwarding and
access control. However, it's a very low-level interface for programming
data-plane algorithms that manipulate state because it requires us to manually
configure a programmable switch pipeline to implement the algorithm. For many
algorithms, e.g., <a
href="http://queue.acm.org/appendices/codel.html">CoDel</a>, the algorithm is
best expressed as a snippet of code in an imperative language.
</p>
<p>
Our compiler backend can autogenerate P4 from packet transactions written in
the Domino language. Looking to the future, we hope this work informs
high-level abstractions for P4.
